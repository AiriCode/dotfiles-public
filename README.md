# dotfiles-public
My personal dot files. 

# Some additional info:
Please change "user" in the bash folder to your own username.

# About the stuff I use:
1. BTOP:
A system monitoring CLI. You could argue it's a GUI with some additional features like themes for top.

2. Fish shell:
I find it an amazing shell for both MacOS and Arch Linux.
