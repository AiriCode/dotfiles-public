# dotfiles-public
My personal dot files. 

# Some additional info:
Please change "user" in the bash folder to your own username.

# About the stuff I use:
1. BTOP:
A system monitoring CLI. You could argue it's a GUI with some additional features like themes for top.

2. Fish shell:
I find it an amazing shell for both MacOS and Arch Linux.

3. Kitty terminal emulator:
An amazing terminal! I use it instead of the boring standard MacOS one.

4. Zsh shell:
Honestly, on MacOS I much prefer the ZSH shell. Oh-my-ZSH and Oh-my-posh are my daily drivers.

5. Yabai as Window Manager and Skhd as keyboard hotkey deamon:
A somewhat common choice on MacOS. My window management is pretty neat and yabai now!
